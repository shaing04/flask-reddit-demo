# Flask Mini-Reddit Clone

**Purpose**

Build a tiny Reddit-like site in Flask that supports voting, posting, and hiding
items—first in memory, then persisted to SQLite.

**What you’ll practice**

- Setting up a small Flask project and running it locally.
- Server-side HTML forms and request/response flow (POST → redirect → GET).
- Mutating in-memory state safely and rendering sorted views.
- Incremental feature development with clear acceptance tests.
- Finding and describing bugs in others’ code.
- Adding persistence with sqlite3 and reasoning about data models.

## Part 1: Getting set up 

**Requirements**

1. Install prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- uv (package manager)

Install uv (macOS/Linux):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. Download the code

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dstl-lab/flask-reddit-demo.git
cd flask-reddit-demo
```

3. Create the virtual environment and install dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

4. Run the app

Run using the Flask CLI:

```bash
uv run flask --app app run --debug
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` and confirm you see the dog links.

## Part 2: Add features 

You’ll add three features by mutating the `dog_links` variable. All actions
should update state on the server, then **redirect** back to `/` so the page
refreshes with the latest data.

### Feature A: Upvotes and downvotes

**Goal**: Users can upvote or downvote a link. After voting, the page reloads and items are always shown from highest score to lowest.

**Behavior**

- When the user clicks the up arrow or down arrow, the app should update that post’s `score` in `dog_links`.
- After updating, redirect to the homepage.
- On the homepage posts should always be ordered by `score` descending.

### Feature B: Submit a new post

**Goal**: Users can add a new post with `title` and `url`. New posts start with **1 upvote by default**.

**Behavior**

- Add a form to submit a new post.
- Validate minimally: a non-empty `title` and a `url` that starts with `http` is fine.
- Append to `dog_links` with `score = 1`.
- Redirect back to `/`, then sort by `score` descending.

**Acceptance tests**

1. Submitting a valid post adds it to the list and displays score `1`.
2. The post is placed relative to others based on its score (1).
3. Empty title or invalid URL is rejected with a friendly message (no crash).

### Feature C: Hide a post

**Goal**: Users can hide any post. Hidden posts are not shown in the main list; instead they appear at the very bottom of the page under a section titled **“Hidden posts”**.

**Behavior**

- Add a "Hide" control for each post; toggling sets a simple flag on that item in `dog_links` (e.g., `hidden: True`).
- The main feed shows only non-hidden posts, sorted by `score` descending.
- At the bottom, render a separate section for **Hidden posts**.
- Within Hidden posts, you may sort by score descending or leave original order—state your choice.

**Acceptance tests**

1. Hiding a post removes it from the main list immediately and places it under “Hidden posts.”
2. Non-hidden posts remain sorted by `score` descending.
3. Page reload after any action reflects the correct grouping and order.

## Part 3: Bug‑finding competition 

1. **Swap projects** with another person on your team. 
2. **Find as many bugs as possible** (logic, UI, validation, sorting edge cases).
3. **Document each bug** with steps, expected vs. actual, and a screenshot if helpful.
4. **Share your findings** with the original author. Discuss overlaps and prevention ideas.

---

## Part 4: Feature request — persistence with SQLite 

Right now `dog_links` resets on restart (e.g. if you stop the Flask app and restart it, the dog links will reset back to its original state). Add persistence with `sqlite3` so posts, votes, and hidden state survive restarts.

**Goal**

- On server start, load posts from a SQLite database.
- When users vote/submit/hide, update the database.
- On page load, query posts (grouped into visible/hidden), and render visible posts sorted by score descending.

**Suggested schema (modify as you see fit)**

- `posts(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT NOT NULL, url TEXT NOT NULL, score INTEGER NOT NULL, hidden INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)`

**Behavior**

- If the DB is empty on first run, **seed** it from the current `dog_links` contents.
- Replace all in‑memory mutations with SQL `INSERT/UPDATE` and read fresh rows before rendering.
- Preserve sorting by `score` descending for the main list; place hidden posts in the bottom section.

**Acceptance tests**

1. After voting/adding/hiding, restart the app; the state is preserved.
2. New posts are stored with score `1` by default.
3. Hidden state persists across restarts.
4. Visible posts always appear sorted by `score` descending.


## Optional stretch goals!

- Unhide a post from the Hidden section.
- Prevent negative scores or display them differently.
- Add delete or edit for posts.
- Add pagination if the list grows long.
- Add simple unit tests for your sort/visibility logic.
- CSS polish and accessibility checks (labels, focus order, contrast).
